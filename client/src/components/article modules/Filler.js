          variety of computers, email accounts, folders, apps and systems.
          However, this kind of ad-hoc information management is messy,
          ineffective and more often and leads to problems and additional work
          down the road. That's just not going to cut it this year."

          you should give Slite a try. Slite's overarching mission is to help
          teams collaborate and work together better, no matter where they're

          first is that we aren't just a knowledge or document management
          solution. Slite is built on the strong belief that knowledge base
          software fail because the information lives too far away from our
          day-to-day jobs. This was true when the knowledge base was a printed
          handbook you stored in your desk drawer, and it's true when it's a
          clunky software you open on your first day on the job, never to be
          looked at again. The content is stale, outdated and useless."

          store any kind of company information you can imagine, ranging from
          meeting minutes & analytics to customer support & CRM information to
          frequently asked questions (FAQs) and technical documentation.
          Knowledge works best when it's where both your customers and your team
          can find you."

          Because every professional team has members with different
          technological abilities, we designed Slite’s user experience to be so
          intuitive that anyone can take it for a spin and immediately get it."
